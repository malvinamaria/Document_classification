#### Why did you choose this topic?

Since I work at FinTech company I wanted to do a project that would look into using supervised learning to gather models for transaction classification that map information relating to the transaction to a category/sub-category combination.
Unfortunately I do not have any dataset that I could work with. So I decided to to work on something that I can practice categorisation framework.
